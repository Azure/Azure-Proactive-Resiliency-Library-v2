{{< toc >}}

## Context/Background

Before diving in, please take a moment to acquaint yourself with the context and background of how this library is built, which will help you contribute effectively moving forward.

- Website: The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator.
- Source Code: Stored in the [APRL GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2), this is also linked in the website's header.
- Hosting: The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

We've chosen Hugo and GitHub Pages to present an easily navigable and consumable library. This combination ensures a user-friendly experience, especially across different devices, including mobile platforms.

### I'm not familiar with Hugo. Is that okay?

Absolutely! You don't need to be. Hugo simply requires you to know how to write markdown (`.md`) files, and it handles the rest when generating the site. üëç

## Prerequisites

To prepare for contributing to APRL, follow the steps below to ensure you're in a "ready state."

A "ready state" means you have forked the [`Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2` repository](https://aka.ms/aprl/repo), cloned it to your local machine, and opened it in VS Code.

### Required Software/Applications

To contribute to this project/repository/library, you will need the following installed:

### Additional Requirements

Ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

- [Create a GitHub profile/account](https://github.com/join)
- Fork the [`Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2` repository](https://aka.ms/aprl/repo) to your GitHub organization/account and clone it locally to your machine.
- Instructions for forking a repository and cloning it can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Running and Accessing a Local Copy of APRL During Development

While in VS Code, you can open a terminal and execute the commands below to access a local copy of the APRL website from a web server provided by Hugo. Access it using the following address: [`http://localhost:1313/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/`](http://localhost:1313/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/):

```text
hugo server --disableFastRender
```

## Creating a pull request

Once you have committed changes to your fork of the APRL repo, you create a pull request to merge your changes into the APRL repo.
