### I'm not familiar with Hugo. Is that okay?

Absolutely! You don't need to be. Hugo simply requires you to know how to write markdown (`.md`) files, and it handles the rest when generating the site. üëç

## Prerequisites

To prepare for contributing to APRL, follow the steps below to ensure you're in a "ready state."

A "ready state" means you have forked the [`Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library` repository](https://aka.ms/aprl/repo), cloned it to your local machine, and opened it in VS Code.

## Running and Accessing a Local Copy of APRL During Development

While in VS Code, you can open a terminal and execute the commands below to access a local copy of the APRL website from a web server provided by Hugo. Access it using the following address: [`http://localhost:1313/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library/`](http://localhost:1313/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library/):

```text
hugo server --disableFastRender
```
