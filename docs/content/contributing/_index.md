This section lists all contribution guidance available to contributors of the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library v2 (APRL). The guidance is broken down into the following sections:

{{< hint type=important >}}

If you cannot find guidance for what you need, please let us know via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/issues) üëç

{{< /hint >}}

## Context/Background

Before jumping in, please familiarize yourself with this context/background on how this library is built to help you contribute going forward.

This [site](https://aka.ms/aprl) is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The source code is stored in the [APRL GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/aprl/repo) (link in header of this site too) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), via the repo.

The reason for the combination of Hugo & GitHub pages is to allow us to present an easy to navigate and consume library, rather than using a native GitHub repo, which is not easy to consume when there are lots of pages and folders. Also Hugo generates the site in such a way that it is also friendly for mobile consumers.

### Other requirements

- [A GitHub profile/account](https://github.com/join)
- A fork of the [`Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library` repo](https://aka.ms/aprl/repo) into your GitHub org/account and cloned locally to your machine
  - Instructions on forking a repo and then cloning it can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

## Creating a pull request

Once you have committed changes to your fork of the APRL repo, you create a pull request to merge your changes into the APRL repo.

## Creating a Azure Resource's Recommendation Page

{{< hint type=important >}}

Make sure you have followed the the [Steps to do before contributing anything (after pre-requisites)](#steps-to-do-before-contributing-anything-after-pre-requisites) before following this section.

## Updating a Azure Resource's Recommendation Page

{{< hint type=important >}}

Make sure you have followed the the [Steps to do before contributing anything (after pre-requisites)](#steps-to-do-before-contributing-anything-after-pre-requisites) before following this section.

{{< /hint >}}

All you need to do is just make edits directly to the resource's `recommendation.yaml` file, save your changes, test your changes, commit, stage and push them to your branch and repo. Then [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) into the `main` branch of the upstream repo and you are done. üëç

## Writing a recommendation

APRL recommendations are intended to enable and accelerate the delivery of Well Architected Reliability Assessments. The purpose of APRL is not to replace existing Azure public documentation and guidance on best practices.

Each recommendation should be actionable for the customer. The customer should be able to place the recommendation in their backlog and the engineer that picks it up should have complete clarity on the change that needs to be made and the specific resources that the change should be made to.

Each recommendation should include a descriptive title, a short guidance section that contains additional detail on the recommendation, links to public documentation that provide additional information related to the recommendation, and a query to identify resources that are not compliant with the recommendation. The title and guidance sections alone should provide sufficient information for a CSA to evaluate a resource.

Recommendations should not require the CSA to spend a lot of time on background reading, they should not be open to interpretation, and they should not be vague. Remember that the CSA delivering the WARA is reviewing a large number of Azure resources in a limited amount of time and is not an expert in every Azure resource.

### Examples

- Good recommendation: Use a /24 subnet for the resource
- Bad recommendation: Size your subnet appropriately

Not all best practices make good APRL recommendations. If the best practice relates to a particular resource configuration and can be checked with an ARG query, it probably makes for a good APRL recommendation. If the best practice is more aligned to general architectural concepts that are true for many Azure resources or workload types, we very likely already have a recommendation in the APRL WAF section that addresses the topic. If not, consider adding a WAF recommendation to APRL. If neither is the case, APRL may not be the best location for this content.

## Automation Standards for Recommendations

When creating recommendations for an Azure resource, please follow the below standards:

### Recommendation categories

Each recommendation should have _**one and only one**_ associated category from this list below.

| Recommendation Category |                                                                                                         Category Description                                                                                                         |

### Azure Resource Graph (ARG) Queries

1. All ARG queries should have two comments at the top of the query, one comment stating `Azure Resource Graph Query` and another comment providing a description of the query results returned. For example:

   ```kql
   // Azure Resource Graph Query
   // Provides a list of Azure Container Registry resources that do not have soft delete enabled
   ```

1. If the ARG query is under development, the query should have a single line stating: `// under-development`

1. If a recommendation query cannot be returned due to limitations with the data provided within ARG, the query should have a single line stating: `// cannot-be-validated-with-arg`

1. Queries should only return resources that do not adhere to the APRL recommendation. For example, if the recommendation is to enable soft delete for Azure Container Registries, the associated query should only return Azure Container Registry resources that do not have soft delete enabled.

1. If a ARG query folder has a file with a file type suffixed with `.fix`, this means that the current query does not work as anticipated and to consider using this as a starting point for fixing the query. Once you have validated that the query is working as anticipated, please remove the file with the `.fix` suffix.

1. ARG query columns name returned should only include the following:

{{< hint type=note >}}

The column names should be in the order they are listed and match exactly.

## Top Tips

1. Sometimes the local version of the website may show some inconsistencies that don't reflect the content you have created.
