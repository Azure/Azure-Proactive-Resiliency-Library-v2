Welcome to the home of the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library v2 (APRL).

{{< figure src="../img/aprl-white.png" width="20%" >}}

This library is built with the intention of being a staging area for guidance and recommendations that can be used by customers, partners and the field in Well-Architected Framework reliability engagements/assessments; with the intent of the guidance and recommendations being promoted, once tested and validated with customers and partners, into the official [Well-Architected Framework documentation](https://aka.ms/waf).

The library also contains supporting [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) queries that can help customers, partners and the field identify resources that may or may not be compliant with the guidance and recommendations. The intent for these queries, in the long-term, is to make them part of the [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) resource.

## Get Started

To get started head over to the [Azure Resources section]({{< ref "azure-resources/_index.md">}}) and then navigate via the appropriate category to find guidance, recommendations alongside supporting Azure Resource Graph queries to help you discover compliant/non-compliant resources in your environment.

You can also use the basic search functionality provided by this site to locate the Azure Resource you are looking for guidance, recommendations and supporting queries and scripts for.
