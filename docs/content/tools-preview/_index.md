This section lists all of the guidance for the new APRL tooling and automation released in preview. With this preview release the APRL automation scripts are now included in a PowerShell module available in the PowerShell Gallery. The spreadsheet produced by the analyzer script has also been updated to improve the workload analysis process and customer deliverable.

The guidance is broken down into the following sections:

- [WARA Collector Documentation](/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/tools-preview/collector)
- [WARA Analyzer Documentation](/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/tools-preview/analyzer)
