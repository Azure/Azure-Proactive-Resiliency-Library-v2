Welcome to the home of the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library v2 (APRL). The purpose of this site is to provide a curated catalog of resiliency recommendations for workloads running in Azure. Many of the recommendations contain supporting [Azure Resource Graph (ARG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) queries to help identify non-compliant resources.
