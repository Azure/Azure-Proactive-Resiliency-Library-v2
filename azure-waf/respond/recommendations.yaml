    Prevention of all problems is a laudable, but impossible goal. Things will go wrong, so we need a plan to limit the impact on our end users and return operations to normal as quickly as possible.

    The key is to respond with urgency, rather than react. A reaction tends to be more impulsive and based in the present moment, without consideration of long-term effects. A response is well-thought-out, organized, and information based.

    Your incident response approach determines your effectiveness at:
    - Understanding what's going on (diagnosing the problem)
    - Triaging (determining the urgency) and prioritizing the problem
    - Engaging the right resources to mitigate the issue(s)
    - Communicating with stakeholders about the problem.
    - After the problem has been remediated, you can then learn from the incident through a post-incident review process. That's an important subject which has a whole separate module worth of discussion.
