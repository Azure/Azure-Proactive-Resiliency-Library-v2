## How to Report Issues and Get Help

This project utilizes GitHub Issues to manage bug reports and feature requests. Before submitting a new issue, please take a moment to search the existing ones to avoid duplicates. If you don't find a similar issue, feel free to file a new one.

You can create and search for issues [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/issues).

When filing an issue, please provide as much detail as possible. Include screenshots or correlation IDs if available (remember to redact any sensitive information).

For instructions on obtaining deployments and correlation IDs, refer to [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-history?tabs=azure-portal#get-deployments-and-correlation-id).

After triaging the issue, we may request that you create an Azure support request following the process outlined [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request).
