### Availability
 
#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Configure at least two regions for high availability** 

It is crucial to enable a secondary region on your Cosmos DB to achieve higher SLA. Doing so does not incur any downtime and it is as easy as selecting a pin on map. Cosmos DB instances utilizing Strong consistency need to configure at least three regions to retain write availability in case of one region failure.

**Potential benefits:** Enhances SLA and resilience.

### Disaster recovery

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Enable service-managed failover for multi-region accounts with single write region** 

Cosmos DB boasts high uptime and resiliency. Even so, issues may arise. With [Service-Managed failover](../reliability-cosmos-db-nosql.md#service-managed-failover), if a region is down, Cosmos DB automatically switches to the next available region, requiring no user action.

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Evaluate multi-region write capability** 

Multi-region write capability allows for designing applications that are highly available across multiple regions, though it demands careful attention to consistency requirements and conflict resolution. Improper setup may decrease availability and cause data corruption due to unhandled conflicts.

**Potential benefits:** Enhances high availability.

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Choose appropriate consistency mode reflecting data durability requirements** 

In a globally distributed database, consistency level impacts data durability during regional outages. Understand data loss tolerance for recovery planning. Use Session consistency unless stronger is needed, accepting higher write latencies and potential write region impact from read-only outages.

**Potential benefits:** Enhances data durability and recovery.

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Configure continuous backup mode** 


Cosmos DB's backup is always on, offering protection against data mishaps. Continuous mode allows for self-serve restoration to a pre-mishap point, unlike periodic mode which requires contacting Microsoft support, leading to longer restore times.


**Potential Benefits:** Faster self-serve data restore.

### System efficiency

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-high.svg"::: **Ensure query results are fully drained** 

Cosmos DB has a 4 MB response limit, leading to paginated results for large or partition-spanning queries. Each page shows availability and provides a continuation token for the next. A while loop in code is necessary to traverse all pages until completion.


**Potential Benefits:** Maximizes data retrieval efficiency.

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-medium.svg"::: **Maintain singleton pattern in your client** 


Using a single instance of the SDK client for each account and application is crucial as connections are tied to the client. Compute environments have a limit on open connections, affecting connectivity when exceeded.



**Potential Benefits:** Optimizes connections and efficiency.

### Application resilience


#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-medium.svg"::: **Implement retry logic in your client** 

Cosmos DB SDKs automatically manage many transient errors through retries. Despite this, it's crucial for applications to implement additional retry policies targeting specific cases that the SDKs can't generically address, ensuring more robust error handling.

**Potential Benefits:** Enhances error handling resilience.

### Monitoring

#### :::image type="icon" source="../media/icon-recommendation-medium.svg"::: **Monitor Cosmos DB health and set up alerts** 

Monitoring the availability and responsiveness of Azure Cosmos DB resources and having alerts set up for your workload is a good practice. This ensures you stay proactive in handling unforeseen events.

**Potential Benefits:** Proactive issue management.
