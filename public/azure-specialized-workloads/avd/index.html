        style="white-space: pre-wrap; padding: 5px; border-radius: 5px; font-family: sans-serif;">RDP Shortpath establishes a direct UDP-based connection between a client and the session host. By default, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tries to establish connection using UDP and uses a TCP-based reverse connect transport as a fallback connection mechanism. UDP-based transport offers better connection reliability and more consistent latency.

And App Attach files should be backed up. Requirements can vary greatly depending on how many packaged applications are stored in an image, and you need to test your applications to understand your requirements.
Your file share should be in the same Azure region as your session hosts.
