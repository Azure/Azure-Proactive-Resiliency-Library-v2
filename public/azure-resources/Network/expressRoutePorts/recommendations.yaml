    Provisioning ExpressRoute circuits on a 10-Gbps or 100-Gbps ExpressRoute Direct resource up to 20-Gbps or 200-Gbps is possible but not recommended for resiliency. If an ExpressRoute Direct port fails, and circuits are using full capacity, the remaining port won't handle the extra load.
  potentialBenefits: Improves resilience during port failures
