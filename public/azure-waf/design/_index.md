The presented Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework recommendations in this guidance include Reliability Stage “2 - Design (Workload Design)” and associated resources and their settings.

In this Stage, the architecture and design decisions are made to meet the requirements defined earlier. Best practices for resilient and scalable systems are implemented, often including redundancy, failover strategies, and load balancing. In this phase failure mode and point analysis are coordinated in order to identify and mitigate possible failures, and single points of failures.
