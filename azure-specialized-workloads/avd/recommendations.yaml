    Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Storage Account and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network. An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.

    It is recommended to enable RDP Shortpath for AVD. RDP Shortpath is a feature of Azure Virtual Desktop that establishes a direct UDP-based transport between a supported Windows Remote Desktop client and session host. By default, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tries to establish connection using UDP and uses a TCP-based reverse connect transport as a fallback connection mechanism. TCP-based reverse connect transport provides the best compatibility with various networking configurations and has a high success rate for establishing RDP connections. UDP-based transport offers better connection reliability and more consistent latency.

    Establish a systematic process for handling image updates within your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Instead of directly updating individual session hosts, create a new version of the updated image. This process involves creating and configuring a golden image with the necessary updates and configurations. Once the new image is prepared, replace existing session hosts with instances using the updated image. This approach ensures consistency across all session hosts and minimizes the risk of configuration drift. Additionally, it enables quick rollback to a previous image version in case of any issues with the update. Implementing this process helps streamline maintenance activities and ensures that all session hosts are up-to-date with the latest configurations and updates.

    Each region has its own scaling plans assigned to host pools within that region. However, these plans can become inaccessible if there's a regional failure. To mitigate this risk, it's advisable to create a secondary scaling plan in another region.

    Ensure that Route Tables have static routes to allow session host traffic that targets AVD control plane to go outbound directly out of the subnet to the internet (next hop), this will avoid any delays of inspecting or adding additional hops in the communication of trusted traffic.

    At least one Validation Pool to have early warning if a planned update to AVD causes an issue. support to adjust limits based on your business requirements. To handle a large number of users, consider scaling horizontally by creating multiple host pools.
    Also check that the host pool has been used regularly to test planned updates.
    Host pools are a collection of one or more identical virtual machines within Azure Virtual Desktop environment. We highly recommend you create a validation host pool where service updates are applied first. Validation host pools let you monitor service updates before the service applies them to your standard or non-validation environment. Without a validation host pool, you may not discover changes that introduce errors, which could result in downtime for users in your standard environment.
    To ensure your apps work with the latest updates, the validation host pool should be as similar to host pools in your non-validation environment as possible. Users should connect as frequently to the validation host pool as they do to the standard host pool. If you have automated testing on your host pool, you should include automated testing on the validation host pool.

    Ensure schedules have been created to provide maintenance windows for AVD agent updates.
    The Scheduled Agent Updates feature lets you create up to two maintenance windows for the Azure Virtual Desktop agent, side-by-side stack, and Geneva Monitoring agent to get updated so that updates don't happen during peak business hours.
