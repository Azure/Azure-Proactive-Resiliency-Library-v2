    Private Link is available for other Azure services that work in conjunction with Azure Virtual Desktop, such as Azure Files and Key Vault. From a resiliency standpoint, we recommending implementing private endpoints for these services to reduce exposure to potential internet-related issues such as latency, packet loss, and/or downtime. This can lead to more reliable communication between AVD and dependent services.

    It is recommended to enable RDP Shortpath for AVD. RDP Shortpath is a feature of Azure Virtual Desktop that establishes a direct UDP-based transport between a supported Windows Remote Desktop client and session host. By default, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tries to establish connection using UDP and uses a TCP-based reverse connect transport as a fallback connection mechanism. TCP-based reverse connect transport provides the best compatibility with various networking configurations and has a high success rate for establishing RDP connections. UDP-based transport offers better connection reliability and more consistent latency.

    It is important to ensure the redundancy of our user profiles when using FSLogix. When using FSLogix with AVD, it is deployed on a file share in a storage account. Data in an Azure Storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region. Below are the options for how your data is replicated in the primary or paired region:
    LRS for least expensive replication (not recommended for apps with high availability and durability).
    - LRS provides eleven 9s durability and replicates three time in a single physical location.
    - ZRS is recommended for apps requiring high availability across zones. ZRS provides twelve 9s durability. Replicated across three availability zones
    - GRS replicates an additional three copies to secondary region and provides sixteen 9s durability.
    - GZRS provides both high availability and redundancy across geo replication. It provides sixteen 9s durability over a given year.
    Generally, it is recommended to store your data as secure and redundant as possible.

    Establish a systematic process for handling image updates within your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. Instead of directly updating individual session hosts, create a new version of the updated image. This process involves creating and configuring a golden image with the necessary updates and configurations. Once the new image is prepared, replace existing session hosts with instances using the updated image. This approach ensures consistency across all session hosts and minimizes the risk of configuration drift. Additionally, it enables quick rollback to a previous image version in case of any issues with the update. Implementing this process helps streamline maintenance activities and ensures that all session hosts are up-to-date with the latest configurations and updates.
