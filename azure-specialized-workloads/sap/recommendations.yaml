    Azure Availability Zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. Use availability zones to protect your applications and data against unlikely data center failures. Ensure each single point of failure of each SAP production system is protected with high availability using multiple availability zones. If you cannot deploy across different zones in a region, then  refer to Microsoft guidance for High availability deployment options for SAP workload.

    Use Virtual Machines Scale Set (VMSS) with flexible orchestration to distribute the virtual machines across specified zones and within each zone to also distribute VMs across different fault domains within the zone on a best effort basis. Configure VMSS Flex following Microsoft recommendation for SAP workload using the right mode and correct settings. If you aren't currently using VMSS Flex for SAP application servers and also not using Availability Sets with Fault domain and Update domain distribution, then you should consider moving to VMSS Flex architecture to improve the resiliency posture of your SAP deployment. The following blog post in links below outlines the details on the process of migrating existing SAP workloads that are deployed in an availability set or availability zone to a flexible scale set with FD=1 deployment option.

    When executing a migrate command in a Linux Pacemaker cluster, the system generates a temporary "prefer" location constraint, aiming to move a resource to a specified node. This constraint prioritizes the target node for the resource temporarily without permanently altering the cluster's configuration.
    During planned maintenances and fail over testing, you can leverage the migrate command for temporary resource relocation during maintenance or administrative tasks to ensure minimal disruption. This constraint is not permanent and does not survive reboots or cluster resets. It's designed for short-term adjustments.
    Once the planned task necessitating the resource migration is complete, manually remove the temporary constraint to revert to the cluster's original resource management policies.
    This approach allows for controlled resource movement within the cluster, facilitating maintenance while preserving the integrity and efficiency of the cluster's configuration.

  longDescription: |
    To ensure the availability of compute resources for critical VM roles in a DR region, consider securing capacity either through a warm standby approach or by utilizing Azure's On-demand Capacity Reservation.

    Warm standby involves keeping VMs in the DR region running. On-demand Capacity Reservation, on the other hand, reserves compute capacity without having to run the VMs, allowing you to start them when needed. When DR VMs are not needed, the reserved capacity may safely be used to run other workloads without the risk of losing the capacity to other customers. This strategy guarantees resource availability for your critical workloads in the event of a disaster, balancing cost and readiness.

    Scheduled events is an Azure Metadata Services that provides proactive notifications about upcoming maintenance events (for example, reboot) so that your application can prepare for them and limit disruption. You should configure scheduled events for all your critical Azure VMs.

    Resource agent azure-events-az can also integrate with Pacemaker clusters.

    To ensure high availability and service continuity in your Azure VMs, you should configure the azure-events-az resource agent within your Pacemaker clusters. This agent monitors for scheduled Azure maintenance events and can proactively relocate resources for a graceful node shutdown. Configure the agent to monitor specific event types such as Reboot and Redeploy, and enable verbose logging for detailed diagnostics.

    In addition, it is also important that you define a procedure on how to react to scheduled events.
