  longDescription:
    Oracle Database@Azure follows a Silver-level reference architecture that provides HA by default however it is vulnerable to AZ failures.
    Gold-level adds Data Guard replication across AZs via Automated DG or manual setup.
    Use SYNC for zero data loss or ASYNC when performance is constrained.
  potentialBenefits: Ensure business continuity in case of zonal failure.
