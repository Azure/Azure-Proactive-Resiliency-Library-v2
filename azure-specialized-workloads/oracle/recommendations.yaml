  longDescription:
    Define a BCDR strategy based on the workload's RPO/RTO requirements.
    Oracle has set of best practices and reference architectures tailored to meet various workload RPO/RTO requirements. This framework is known as the Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA).
    By default, The Oracle Database@Azure solution follows a Silver level reference architecture. The primary database residing in ExaDB-D provides high availability, data protection, elasticity, and scalability benefits, however it is vulnerable to any AZ failure.
    Gold-level reference architectures with Oracle Database@Azure are recommended, meaning that database changes will be replicated via Data Guard to a secondary Oracle Database@Azure instance in a different availability zone within the same region.
    Data Guard can be configured using the Automated DG feature in the OCI Portal, and manual configuration is also possible.
  potentialBenefits: Ensure business continuity in case of zonal failure.

    Regional replication is a key strategy to ensure business continuity and disaster recovery for your Oracle workloads in case of a regional failure.

  longDescription: |
    Oracle RAC is ideal for high-volume applications or consolidated environments where scalability and the ability to dynamically add or re-prioritize capacity across more than a single server are required. An individual database may have instances running on one or more nodes of a cluster. Similarly, a database service may be available on one or more database instances. Additional nodes, database instances, and database services can be provisioned online.
    Monitor database metrics such as CPU utilization and memory usage using Azure Monitor. Set alerts for specific thresholds to trigger scaling decision when your workload reaches critical levels.
    Auto-scaling is not available on ODAA Exadata Database Service.
    Be mindful that the capacity of Vm cluster is deployed according to the workload requirements.
    If scaling up is needed, scale up the number of OCPUs on the VM cluster, if there is capacity available on the Exa infra.
  potentialBenefits: Meet workload scalability requirements.

    It is important to design an IP addressing scheme taking into consideration the current and future requirements of your Oracle workloads. This will help you to avoid IP address conflicts and ensure that your Oracle workloads are always available.
    Primary, standby, client and backup subnets should be designed without overlapping IP CIDR ranges.
