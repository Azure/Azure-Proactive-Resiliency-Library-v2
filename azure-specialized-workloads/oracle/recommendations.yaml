  longDescription:
    Define a BCDR strategy based on workload RPO/RTO.
    Oracle Database@Azure follows a Silver-level reference architecture that provides high availability by default however it is vulnerable to AZ failures.
    Gold-level adds Data Guard replication across AZs via Automated DG or manual setup.
  potentialBenefits: Ensure business continuity in case of zonal failure.
