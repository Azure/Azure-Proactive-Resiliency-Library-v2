  longDescription:
    Define a BCDR strategy based on the workload's RPO/RTO requirements.
    Oracle has set of best practices and reference architectures tailored to meet various workload RPO/RTO requirements. This framework is known as the Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA).
    By default, The Oracle Database@Azure solution follows a Silver level reference architecture. The primary database residing in ExaDB-D provides high availability, data protection, elasticity, and scalability benefits, however it is vulnerable to any AZ failure.
    Gold service level reference architectures with Oracle Database@Azure is recommended. It could be within the same Azure Region or across one or more Azure Regions.
  potentialBenefits: The cloud MAA architecture achieves comprehensive data protection and disaster recovery.

  recommendationResourceType: Specialized.Workload/oracle
  recommendationMetadataState: Active
  longDescription: |
    Oracle RAC is ideal for high-volume applications or consolidated environments where scalability and the ability to dynamically add or re-prioritize capacity across more than a single server are required. An individual database may have instances running on one or more nodes of a cluster. Similarly, a database service may be available on one or more database instances. Additional nodes, database instances, and database services can be provisioned online.
    Auto-scaling is not avaialble on ODAA.
    Be mindful that the capacity of Vm cluster is deployed according to the workload requirements.
    If scaling up is needed, scale up the number of OCPUs on the VM cluster, if there is capacity available on the Exa infra.
  potentialBenefits: Meet workload scalability requirements.

    It is important to design an IP addressing scheme taking into consideration the current and future requirements of your Oracle workloads. This will help you to avoid IP address conflicts and ensure that your Oracle workloads are always available.
    Primary, standby, client and backup subnets should be designed without overlapping IP CIDR ranges.
  potentialBenefits: Avoid conflicts in IP addressing for the database, application and backup infrastructure.
