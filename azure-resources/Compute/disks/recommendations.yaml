  longDescription: |
    Azure disks offers a zone-redundant storage (ZRS) option for workloads that need to be resilient to an entire zone being down. Due to the cross-zone data replication, ZRS disks have higher write latency when compared to the locally-redundant option (LRS), so make sure to benchmark your disks.
