    Keeping a minimum of 3 replicas for production images in Azure's Compute Gallery ensures scalability and prevents throttling in multi-VM deployments by distributing VM deployments across different replicas. This reduces the risk of overloading a single replica.
  potentialBenefits: Enhances scalability and avoids throttling

    Use ZRS for high availability when creating image/VM versions in Azure Compute Gallery, offering resilience against Availability Zone failures. ZRS accounts are advisable in regions with Availability Zones, with the choice of Standard_ZRS recommended over Standard_LRS for these regions.

    We recommend creating Trusted Launch Supported Images for benefits like Secure Boot, vTPM, trusted launch VMs, large boot volume. These are Gen 2 Images by default and you cannot change a VM's generation after creation, so review the considerations first.
