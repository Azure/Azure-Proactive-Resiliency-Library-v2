    It is crucial to enable a secondary region on your Cosmos DB to achieve higher SLA. Doing so does not incur any downtime and it is as easy as selecting a pin on map. Cosmos DB instances utilizing Strong consistency need to configure at least three regions to retain write availability in case of one region failure.

    In a globally distributed database, consistency level impacts data durability during regional outages. Understand data loss tolerance for recovery planning. Use Session consistency unless stronger is needed, accepting higher write latencies and potential write region impact from read-only outages.
