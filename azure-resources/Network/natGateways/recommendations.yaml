  longDescription: |
    When you scale your workload, assume that each flow requires a new SNAT port, and then scale the total number of available IP addresses for outbound traffic. Carefully consider the scale you're designing for, and then allocate IP addresses accordingly.

  longDescription: |
    Connecting from your Azure virtual network to Azure PaaS services can be done directly over the Azure backbone and bypass the internet. When you bypass the internet to connect to other Azure PaaS services, you free up SNAT ports and reduce the risk of SNAT port exhaustion.
