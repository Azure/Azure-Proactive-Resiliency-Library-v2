  longDescription: |
    NAT Gateway provides 64,512 SNAT ports per public IP address and supports up to 16 public IP addresses. Monitor "Total SNAT connection count" metric to determine if you're nearing the connection limit of NAT gateway. You can scale the NAT gateway by adding more public IP addresses.

  longDescription: |
    A zonal promise for zone isolation scenarios exists when a virtual machine instance using a NAT gateway resource is in the same zone as the NAT gateway resource and its public IP addresses. The pattern you want to use for zone isolation is creating a "zonal stack" per availability zone.
