  longDescription: |
    If your region supports AZs, no additional action is needed unless you require enhanced resiliency or cross-region failover. For regions without AZs, implement disaster recovery by deploying Private DNS Resolvers in multiple regions and configuring cross-region failover to ensure reliability.
  potentialBenefits: Improved DR readiness, and support for multi-region failover during regional outages.
