   Ensure you have a recovery strategy defined. Check regional availability and paired regions. Machine Learning doesn't have auto failover. Therefore, you must design a strategy that encompasses the workspace and all its dependencies, such as Key Vault, Azure Storage, and Container Registry.
  potentialBenefits: Provides multi-region disaster recovery strategy and enhanced reliability

    If your primary workspace is unavailable, switch to the secondary workspace to continue work. Azure Machine Learning doesn't auto-submit jobs to the secondary workspace during an outage. Update your code configuration to point to the new workspace resource.

    Create compute resources for training a Machine Learning model in selected regions. Ensure both regions have sufficient compute quota for dynamically scaling resources. Customers must configure high availability across zones for attached compute resources like AKS, Azure Databricks, Container Instances, and HDInsight.
