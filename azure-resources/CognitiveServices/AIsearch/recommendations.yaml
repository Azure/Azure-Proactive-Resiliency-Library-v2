    Availability zones are utilized when you add two or more replicas to your search service. Each replica is assigned to a different availability zone within the region. If the number of replicas exceeds the available zones in the region, the replicas are distributed across the zones as evenly as possible.

  longDescription: |
    Azure AI Search does not offer automatic failover in the event of an outage. To ensure application continuity, recovery, and improved response times for a global audience, you can deploy multiple search services across different regions. This can be achieved by creating several services and developing a data synchronization strategy, such as using indexers to update content across multiple services or leveraging REST APIs to push content updates to them. Additionally, you can use a resource like Azure Traffic Manager to manage request routing.
