  longDescription: |
    Active Geo Replication is a business continuity solution that utilizes a readable secondary database replica. In the event of a primary database failure, perform a manual failover to the secondary database and ensure your application points to the appropriate endpoint. Until you fail over, the secondary database remains read-only. Active geo-replication enables you to create readable replicas and manually failover to any replica if there is a datacenter outage. Up to four secondaries are supported in the same or different regions, and the secondaries can also be used for read-only access queries.

    Failover Groups are a disaster recovery feature that enables you to configure databases contained on a logical server to replicate to a logical server in another region. Failover groups simplify the management of geo-replicated databases and enable a single endpoint that automatically routes connections to the replicated databases in the event of a failure of the primary logical server.

  longDescription: |
    By default, when you provision an Azure SQL Database with the premium tier, multiple copies of the database are created within the same azure region. To support geo redundancy, Databases can be provisioned (or existing databases can be modified) as Zone Redundant, which locates the copies in different Azure Availability Zones. This will ensure database availability in the event of a regional outage.

    When transient failures occur between the application and the Azure SQL Database environment, it is important that the application manages connection retries in an appropriate manner. There is no configuration necessary at the Database layer, but the application must be configured to retry gracefully.
