    Failover Groups are a disaster recovery feature that enables you to configure databases contained on a logical server to replicate to a logical server in another region. Failover groups simplify the management of geo-replicated databases and enable a single endpoint that automatically routes connections to the replicated databases in the event of a failure of the primary logical server.

  longDescription: |
    When provisioning an Azure SQL Database with the premium tier, by default, multiple copies are created within the same region. For geo redundancy, databases can be provisioned or modified as Zone Redundant, placing copies in different Azure Availability Zones to ensure availability during regional outages. This will ensure database availability in the event of a regional outage.

    When transient failures occur between the application and the Azure SQL Database environment, it is important that the application manages connection retries in an appropriate manner. There is no configuration necessary at the Database layer, but the application must be configured to retry gracefully.
