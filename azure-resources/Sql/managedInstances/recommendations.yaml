  longDescription: |
    Azure SQL Managed Instance offers built-in availability by deploying multiple replicas in the same zone. For higher availability, use a zone-redundant configuration that spreads replicas across three Azure availability zones, each with independent power, cooling, and networking.

    Configuring zone redundancy option for backups copies your backup file synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. If Geo is selected, then it copies your data asynchronously three times to a single physical location in the paired secondary region.

    Redirect mode enables direct connectivity to the instance bypassing the local gateway component and resulting in improved latency and throughput. Redirect mode applies to the VNet-local endpoint only, while the public and private endpoint will always operate in Proxy connection mode.

    During an outage on the managed instance, use the failover group to switch all databases to a secondary region, either manually or automatically. Route connections to the failover group’s listener instead of the primary instance to avoid changing the connection string after geo-failover.
